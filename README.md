## Key Design Choices

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Pattern**: Components are organized following atomic design principles
  - Atoms: Basic UI elements
  - Organisms: Complex components like `FilterPanel` and `Pagination`
  - Templates: Page layouts
  - Pages: Complete pages like `Home`

### State Management
- **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for centralized state management
  - Manages complex state for:
    - Search queries
    - Filters
    - Sorting
    - Pagination
  - Provides predictable state updates and easy debugging

### UI/UX Design
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Bottom sheet filter panel for mobile devices
  - Sidebar filters for desktop
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Loading states with Lottie animations
  - Hover effects on cards
  - Smooth transitions for filter panel
- **Accessibility**:
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - ARIA labels
  - Keyboard navigation support

## Challenges and Solutions

### Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: Handling large datasets with filtering and sorting
**Solution**:
- Implemented client-side filtering and sorting
- Added pagination to limit rendered items
- Used memoization for expensive computations
- Optimized re-renders using React's useMemo and useCallback

### Mobile Responsiveness
**Challenge**: Creating an intuitive filtering experience on mobile
**Solution**:
- Implemented a bottom sheet filter panel
- Added touch-friendly UI elements
- Used responsive grid layouts
- Implemented smooth animations for panel transitions

### Testing Strategy
**Challenge**: Ensuring reliable component testing
**Solution**:
- Comprehensive test suite using Jest and React Testing Library
- Mocked external dependencies
- Test coverage for:
  - Component rendering
  - User interactions
  - State management
  - Edge cases

### State Management Complexity
**Challenge**: Managing complex filter states and search functionality
**Solution**:
- Implemented Redux Toolkit for predictable state updates
- Created separate slices for different features
- Used selectors for efficient state access
- Implemented clear action creators

## Future Improvements

1. **Server-Side Rendering**:
   - Implement SSR for better SEO
   - Add server-side filtering and sorting

2. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Add image lazy loading
   - Implement caching strategies

3. **Feature Additions**:
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Save favorite cars
   - Compare cars feature
   - User authentication

4. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Enhanced keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader optimizations
   - Color contrast improvements

## Development Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Clear component hierarchy
   - Consistent file naming
   - Modular code structure

2. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for features
   - End-to-end testing for critical paths

3. **Styling**:
   - Consistent use of Tailwind classes
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Theme customization

4. **Performance**:
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Optimized builds
